COLOR SHIFTER

The "Color Shifter" is a special editor tool and shader set, which works in URP, HDRP, and Built-In pipelines.

URP/HDRP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Find the .unitypackage for each render pipeline in the Assets/InfinityPBR/Low Poly Support Files/Shaders
2. Open the correct one, which will bring in the shader
3. Find the material ("Color Shifter") for the character, and change the shader to the correct one (same name with "-URP" or "-HDRP" at the end)
4. Success! You can also delete the shader you're not using.

The Color Shifter makes it easy to create custom color sets for characters.
